Shasta Release 0.10.0
2024-Mar-10 11:18:01.687374 Assembly begins.
Command line:
/netfiles/nunezlab/Shared_Resources/Software/shasta/shasta-Linux-0.10.0 --input /netfiles/pespenilab_share/Nucella/processed/ONT_fltlong/Nuc.3500.fltlong.fastq --config Nanopore-May2022 
For options in use for this assembly, see shasta.conf in the assembly directory.
This run uses options "--memoryBacking 4K --memoryMode anonymous".
This could result in performance degradation.
For full performance, use "--memoryBacking 2M --memoryMode filesystem"
(root privilege via sudo required).
Therefore the results of this run should not be used
for benchmarking purposes.
This assembly will use 128 threads.

This run used options "--memoryBacking 4K --memoryMode anonymous".
This could have resulted in performance degradation.
For full performance, use "--memoryBacking 2M --memoryMode filesystem"
(root privilege via sudo required).
Therefore the results of this run should not be used
for benchmarking purposes.
